# Underwater Soft Robot Design
Today, almost all underwater exploration
and repair is performed by human divers
or rigid robots. Rigid robots are built with
the risk of water pressure, and are
especially vulnerable to blunt force,
essentially restricting them from operating
in tight environments. Human underwater
welders face an extremely dangerous
profession, with an estimated death rate of
15%. As underwater infrastructure like
offshore windmills continue to grow, there
is a great need for a safer alternative.
Soft robots are robots that are mostly or
entirely made of flexible materials. They
provide a number of benefits like inherent
adaptability, resistance to blunt force, and
pressure resistance. Due to the unique
feature and advantages, soft robots have a
great potential to be used underwater.
However, they must also rely on
unconventional actuation, and complicated
control schemes as a result of their
flexibility.

# Prototype of a leg with nitinol and silicones 
Prototypes of a robot leg were built and tested for range of motion using nitinol 
and silicones. In addition, the entire proposed robot was modeled and simulated under high water pressure conditions.
The package contains the literature review, the ***CAD*** design, code, and posters.

# Test results and conclusion
The results demonstrate the feasibility of
an underwater soft robot. While an
average angle of 13 degrees is far from
ideal, it is clear proof of concept that a soft
robot could be entirely actuated with
nitinol. In addition, under 50 meters of
simulated water pressure, only the narrow
silicone tubes experience any significant
pressure, and their deformation is low
enough not to significantly impact robot
function. The final design is remarkably
simple and cheap to build, costing under
$30 and requiring only a 3D printer and
soldering iron as tools. However, this
prototype clearly suffers from a lack of
power, and its performance over extended
periods of operation remain untested.
